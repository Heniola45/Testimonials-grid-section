I signed up for <br>the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.

They were very hands-on <br>and I never had to wait long for <br>assistance. The agile team project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took <br>my learning to the next level in a way <br>that no tutorial could ever have. In <br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br>interviews as an example of my <br>developent experience. It certainly <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br>offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
